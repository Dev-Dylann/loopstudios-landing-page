## My Process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Fonts from [Google Fonts](https://)

### What I Learned

One of the major things I learned durring this project was the `group` class in Tailwind that lets me style elements based on the state of a parent element.

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The Tailwind Documentation really helped me discover classes I wasn't previously familiar with like `leading-{size}`, `tracking-{size}` and `origin-{position}`.
